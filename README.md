# Bitbucket Integration Pack

Pack for integration of Bitbucket into StackStorm. The pack includes the
functionality to perform actions on Bitbucket through StackStorm.

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [bitbucket.yaml.example](./bitbucket.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/bitbucket.yaml` and edit as required.

It must contain:

* ``username`` - Bitbucket username
* ``password`` - Bitbucket password
* ``email`` - Email associated with bitbucket username

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the
[docs](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/pack_configs.html) for more info.

## Rules

### Post-Receive WebHook

This rule triggers ``packs.deploy`` action (in StackStorm v1.4+) to allow
auto-deployment of single pack repository.

This has a number of pre-dependancies:

- The repository being configured in:

```bash
/opt/stackstorm/packs/packs/config.yaml
```

- Setting Workflow / Hooks / Post-Receive WebHooks pointing at the URL:

```
https://<my-server>/api/v1/webhooks/bitbucket_post_receive?st2-api-key=<ST2-API-Key>
```

- The rule is disabled by default and needs to be enabled with

```bash
st2 rule enable bitbucket.post_receive_webhook
```

*Important:* The BitBucket server (or cloud) needs to be able to reach
your StackStorm server and consider the SSL cert as valid. The
`ST2-API-Key` should be generated as per the instructions at
https://docs.stackstorm.com/authentication.html.
